# Machine Learning Project : "Book Recommendation System by using Cosine Similarity Machine Learning Model"
### ~ Research Paper link is also attached.


# What is the Purpose of this Project?

Cosine Similarity is Mathematical Concept which is used to calculate inner distance between two items and this algorithm is used in this Machine Learning Model to find inner distance between books(means similarity between books) to categories books in categories and recommend other books with similar nature.

# Industry Requirement?

This Recommendation System is used in many Tech products and services; This Cosine Similarity algorithm is a new way of categorising items and used in **Product Based Companies**.
